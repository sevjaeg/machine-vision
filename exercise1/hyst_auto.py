    Apply automatic hysteresis thresholding by automatically choosing the high and low thresholds of standard
    hysteresis threshold. low_prop is the proportion of edge pixels which are above the low threshold and high_prop is
    the proportion of pixels above the high threshold.

    :param high_prop: Proportion of pixels which should lie above the high threshold
